# Java-Calculator
A simple java calculator I wrote in high school as an assignment.
Features:
  Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication)
  Squaring
  Square Rooting
  Negation
  Can save and load an answer with Memo 1 button
  Other non calculator related buttons such as "Meme" and "Royal Promise"

What It cannot do:
  Input directly on the screen instead of buttons
  Cannot perform complex expressions i.e (3+2/8). The calculator will perform 3+2, then returns an answer of 5.0 then performs 5/8
  Return answers as integers when it can be returned as an integer. i.e 3 will always be returned as 3.0
  
  
Updates:
  12/17: added a proper description for this program
