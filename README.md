# Java-Calculator
A simple java calculator I wrote in high school as an assignment.

I decided to take a second look at this project I wrote and make minor modifications (and the inclusion of the WindowDestroyer class to make it work) to it.
## Features:
* Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication)
* Squaring
* Square Rooting
* Negation
* Can save and load an answer with Memo 1 button
* Other non calculator related buttons such as "Meme" and "Royal Promise"

## What It cannot do:
* Input directly on the screen instead of buttons
* Cannot perform complex expressions i.e (3+2/8). The calculator will perform 3+2, then returns an answer of 5.0 then performs 5/8
* Return answers as integers when it can be returned as an integer. i.e 3 will always be returned as 3.0
